# CLASS 27 NOTES - `useState()` Hook

***1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?***

- React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
- JSX describes what the UI should look like and produces React elements, which can be rendered to the DOM.

***2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?***

- A function component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
- A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element.

***3. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Functional Components** - React components, or JavaScript functions, that accept a single props object argument with data and return a React element.
- **Children / Child Components** - allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop, using JSX.
