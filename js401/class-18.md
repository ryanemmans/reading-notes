# CLASS 18 NOTES - AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

***1. What are serverless functions?***

- Single-purpose, programmatic functions that are invoked through the Internet and hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.

***2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?***

- I would learn to use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) framework using the CLI to create, build, deploy, and test lambda functions locally.

***3. Describe how a CDN works***

- It is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible.  To improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks.

***4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Serverless Functions** - single-purpose, programmatic functions that are invoked through the Internet and hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.
- **Cloud Storage** - a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service.
- **CDN** - Content Delivery Network. Refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
