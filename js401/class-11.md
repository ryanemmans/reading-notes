# CLASS 11 NOTES - Event Driven Applications

***1. Why is access control important?***

- It is one of the key foundations of having a comprehensive security strategy in an organization or enterprise. It is the authorization to system resources after a user has been granted access to a system after being authenticated.

***2. Describe an application that would need access control.***

- Any application that carries data that could be personal and would need to be kept secure. These applications would also utilize authentication and authorization to determine roles and capabilities of users.

***3. What is a role used for?***

- A role designates CRUD capabilities to a user, such as admin, editor, writer, or generic user.

***4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?***

- RBAC takes a real world approach to structuring access control. It is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the system belongs. Discretionary allows users to control access to their own data, under the control of a system administrator. Mandatory is very strict and is primarily used at a government level.

***5. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Authorization** - Once a user has been authenticated (proven who they are), authorization determines what they are allowed to do, or the capabilties they will have access to.
- **Role Based Access Control** - restricts network access or CRUD capabilities based on a person's role within an organization.
- **Capabilities** - levels of access that employees have to the network. E.g. admin, editor, writer, generic user, or which roles are able to create, read, update, or delete.
