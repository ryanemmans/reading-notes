# CLASS 16 NOTES - AWS: Cloud Servers

***1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle***

- The client will make a request to the server using an HTTP method, most commonly POST, GET, PUT, or DELETE. The server will then send back a response to the client that contains a header, message body, and a status code. The browser will then render the HTTP response body message, either the request that was made or an error status code.

***2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC***

- The server responds back to the requests made by the client in the form of a header, body message, and status code.

***3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?***

- Deployment is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application(s) usually through an application management system, to a specific URL on a server. In other words, publishing an app to the web.

***4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Server** - a piece of hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called clients
- **Pub/Sub** - Publisher/Subscriber, allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds. Used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. Equally effective as messaging-oriented middleware.
- **WRRC** - Web-Request-Response-Cycle - Client sends an HTTP request to the server, server responds to the client with a header, message body, and status code.
