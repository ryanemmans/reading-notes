# CLASS 36 NOTES - Application State with Redux

***1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”***

- Tokens in local storage are vulnerable to XSS attacks. Cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, making them less vulnerable. Using the `sameSite` flag can help prevent CSRF attacks.

***2. Explain 3rd party cookies.***

- Third-party cookie are stored under a different domain than the user is currently visiting. They are mostly used to track users between websites and display more relevant ads between websites. Without realizing it, users are creating a "trail of crumbs."

***3. How do pixel tags work?***

- Also know as tracking pixels, they obtain and analyze data that is unknowingly provided by users when visiting a webpage or reading an email. This data can include OS, time visited, website type, client type (browser or email application), IP address, site activities, and screen resolutions.

***4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Cookies** - text files with small pieces of data (e.g.: username / password) that are used to identify your computer as you use a network. Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon connection, which is labeled with an ID unique to the user and their device.
- **Authorization** - process of granting or denying a user access to resources, taking place after Authentication.
- **Access control** - dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Makes sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.
- **Conditional Rendering** - rendering distinct components depending on the state of your application using if statements or conditional (ternary) operators.
