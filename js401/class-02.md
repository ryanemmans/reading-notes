# CLASS 2 NOTES - Express

***1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?***

- `PUT` is an HTTP request method that is a complete representation of a resource. It creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload. Calling it once or several times successively has the same effect.
- `PATCH` is an HTTP request method that can be considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. This can be thought of as 'updating.'

***2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server***

- [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)
- [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)
- [Mocky.io](https://designer.mocky.io/)

***3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js***

- Swagger allows you to describe the structure of APIs so that machines can read them. By reading an API’s structure, we can automatically build interactive API documentation.
- ApiDoc creates documentation from API annotations in your source code and includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated api_data.js and api_project.js as an html-page.

***4. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?***

- Status code 100s are informational.
- Status code 200s indicate success.
- Status code 300s indicate ridirection where further action is needed by the user.
- Status code 400s indicate a client error.
- Status code 500s indicate a server error.

***5. Compare and contrast SOAP and REST***

- SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
  - SOAP was designed before REST, it is a protocol.
  - It requires more bandwidth than REST
  - It only works with XML formats.
  - SOAP ***cannot*** make use of REST.
- REST - Representational State Transfer
  - REST is an architectural pattern
  - It was designed specifically for working with components such as media, files, or even hardware objects.
  - It works with plaintext, XML, HTML, and JSON.
  - REST ***can*** make use of SOAP.

***6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- Web Server - computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web pages, or its secure variant HTTPS. It can be a single computer or an embedded system.
- Express - a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- Routing - a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. The Router determines what should happen when a user visits a certain page.
- WRRC - Web Request Response Cycle - traces how a user's request flows through the app.
