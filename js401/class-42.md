## [Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcement](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)

I found this article to be quite triggering as with most all news I read nowadays as I have very firm beliefs on both Amazon as a company and the current state as well as the history of law enforcement in this country. This statement from Nicole Ozer really stood out to me: Amazon's face surveillance technology is "a unique threat to civil rights and especially to the immigrants and people of color under attack by this administration,” She is the technology and civil liberties director at the ACLU of California.

The article goes on to discuss the letter that was written to Jeff Bezos with demands from employees and shareholders in regard to providing facial recognition software to law enforcement and enabling ICE. I back the letter completely, but I doubt Jeff even read it. At present day, big tech holds an obscene amount of power, and with that comes a lot of ethic responsibility where some are really trying to do good and make change.

This article was published back in 2018 when Trump was still in office, and shortly after the killing of George Floyd Amazon had taken action to ban Rekognition. To the best of my knowledge, this ban is currently still in effect.
