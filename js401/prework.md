### Common Mistakes

- Allocation of time
  - (Measure twice, cut once!)
- Writing code as soon as possible
- Trying to oversolve the solution on first iteration
  - Keep it simple.

### A Simple Set of Steps

#### 1. Read the Problem Completely, Twice

- Maybe even 3 or 4 times.
- Have a complete understanding. (Can you explain the problem to someone else?) *Important!*
- Work through examples, if given.

#### 2. Solve the Problem Manually

- “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually.”
- Solve with at least 3 different inputs to fully understand solution.
- Mathematical Induction - solve for 1, then 2, then n.
- Check for corner cases and edge cases.
- You may need to write everything out that you're thinking to be aware of each step.

#### 3. Optimize the Manual Solution

- Figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem more easily.
- Are there steps that can be cut out or simplified?

#### 4. Write Pseudo-Code or Comments

- Important for beginners
- We will then know what the structure of our code will look like.

#### 5. Replace Comments With Real Code

- Reasons for struggling here:
  1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps.
  2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion. (I feel attacked)
- If 1: Go back to step 2 and be as meticulous as possible.
- If 2: Learn how to do the following asap:
  - Create a list
  - Sort a list or array
  - Create a map or dictionary
  - Loop through a list, or dictionary
  - Parse strings
  - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc.

#### 6. Optimize the Real Code

- Only necessary if you can cut out lines or simplify
- Variables should have meaningful names

### A Few Final Tips

- As much as 70% of time should be spent on steps 1-3.
- Key to doing well is having confidence. (Practice!)
- If more complicated problems have multiple, larger steps:
  - Try to cut problem directly in half and follow above process for each half. (Divide and conquer)

## ***Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive***

If one values their time, they could become exponentially more productive, focused and effective.

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

- It takes discipline to not become "busy."
- Your time must be budgeted.

>### “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.” - Jeff Goins

- With focus, one must make *tangible* steps toward their goals.
- When you're busy, you are on autopilot. This is time you will never get back.

### Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy

- Busyness can translate into distraction and procrastination.
- Success is achieved by having zero tolerance for these things.
- One must have a crystal clear vision of their goals, and work towards them every single day.

>### “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.” - Cal Newport on developing productive results and entering flow states

- You must cultivate extreme focus to achieve maximum productivity, making the most of your time.
- If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.

### As You Think, So You Are

- You teach people how to treat you.
- If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
- What you think is what you become.
- "Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken."
- Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and others will treat it as such.

### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

- Teach yourself to say "no" more.
- Saying no creates more space to focus on your mission.
- When we say yes to something, we're saying no to a dozen other opportunities.
- Weeding out the merely “good” for the truly great opportunities is easier when you value your time.

### In Conclusion

- How many of your activities are worthy of your valuable time vs a true waste of time?
- The higher the value of your time, the more important and productive work you'll do.
  - And the less trivial and mindless tasks you'll get caught up in.

## ***How to Think Like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving***

>“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” - Steve Jobs

### Why is this important?

- Problem solving is the meta-skill.
- Trying solutions until you finally find one that works is a huge waste of time.
- Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for.

### Have a framework

#### 1. Understand

- Know exactly what is being asked.
- Be able to explain it in plain English.

#### 2. Plan

- Analyze the problem, process the information
- “Given *input* X, what are the steps necessary to return *output* Y?”

#### 3. Divide

- Pay attention. Break the problem down into sub-problems, which are easier to solve.
- Begin with the simplest and solve each one by one.
- Connect the dots of sub-solutions.
- Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it. Then expand and rewrite the solution.

#### 4. Stuck?

- Debug - go through step by step to see where you went wrong.
- Reassess - Look at the problem from another perspective. Try to solve at a more general level.
  - Or delete everything and start anew with fresh eyes.
- Research - Use Google.
- Look for solutions to sub-problems instead of the big problem.
  - Otherwise you won't learn anything and you've wasted your time.

#### 5. Practice

- Find an outlet - chess, math, sudoku, video games, etc.
- Develop the habit of practicing "micro problem solving." Ideally, something you enjoy.

## ***5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly***

[https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

- - -

The 5 Whys is a simple yet powerful tool that can reveal the underlying causes of a problem, enabling one to achieve a solution.

### Origins of the 5 Whys Technique

- Developed by Sakichi Toyoda in the 1930s
- "Go and see" philosophy - what is **actually** happening vs what is **thought** to be happening
- Drill a problem down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five (or so) times to establish a counter-measure.

Counter-measure - "an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again."

- More robust and effective than solutions. Solutions tend to only deal with symptoms.

### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

- Troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving.
- Most effective for simple or moderately difficult problems.

### How to Use the 5 Whys

#### 1. Assemble a Team

- People who are familiar with specifics of the problem and process that needs fixing.
- Assign a facilitator to keep team focused on identifying counter-measures.

#### 2 Define the Problem

- Should be a brief and clear statement discussed with team.
- Leave space to answer the "Whys"

#### 3. Ask the First "Why?"

- Answers should be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
- Answers should be succinct phrases.

#### 4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

- In response to previous answer.
- There may be multiple reasons for each Why.
  - Requires you to reach root cause for each branch.

#### 5. Know When to Stop

- When asking "why" produces no more useful responses.
- Counter-measure or process change should then be evident. (Cause & Effect Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, Failure Mode & Effects Analysis)

#### 6. Address the Root Cause(s)

- Discuss and agree on counter-measures that will prevent problem from recurring.

#### 7. Monitor Your Measures

- They may need to be amended or replaced entirely.
- Repeating 5 Whys may be necessary to identify correct root cause.
