# CLASS 17 NOTES - AWS: S3 and Lambda

***1. Describe “The Cloud”***

- Instead of a physical entity, it is a vast network of remote servers all over the world that are connected and meant to operate as a single ecosystem. The servers can store or manage data, run applications, or deliver content or services.

***2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?***

- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

***3. What is auto-scaling?***

- Auto-scaling is a service that monitors your applications and automatically adjusts compute resources to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

***4. What is bandwidth?***

- Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

***5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?***

- Setting prices related to a cloud environment include network, compute, and storage. Network relates to hardware costs and infrastructure maintenance. Compute is the cost per GB of Virtual *RAM* with hardware operation and acquisition. Finally, storage is the cost per GB of Virtual *Disc*.

***6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Server Instances** - a virtual machine which runs our workloads in the cloud.
- **Containers** -standard units of software that package up code and all its dependencies so an application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Cloud Services** - any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider’s servers as opposed to being provided from a company’s own on-premises servers. Designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
- **Cloud Architecture** - refers to components such as databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. and the relationships between these components.
- **AWS** - provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to on a metered pay-as-you-go basis, with a basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools.
- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** - Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features such as auto-scaling. AWS pricing is fairly linear. In contrast, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running. AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.
