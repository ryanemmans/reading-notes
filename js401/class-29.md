# CLASS 29 NOTES - Advanced State with Reducers

***1. How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?***

- To run an effect only once on mount and unmount, you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesnâ€™t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

***2. Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?***

- I don't believe so. You would need to use two different useState calls which would update state variables separately.

***3. Is useState() synchronous?***

- In React, all state updates are asynchronous, both in classed based components as well as with functions and hooks.

***4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **State Hook** - lets you add React state to function components, instead of having to convert them to a class.
- **Component Lifecycle** - Phases or methods of a component that are used for mounting, updating, unmounting, and error handling.
