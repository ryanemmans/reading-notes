# CLASS 28 NOTES - Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

***1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?***

- We only need a single `index.html` for the browser to reference because we can use React Router to route to other components (all .js files) from our App.js.
  - This creates multiple pages within a single page application.

***2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?***

- We would put this component inside the `<BrowserRouter/>`, but outside a `<Route/>`. An example of this would be a `Navbar` component.
- In contrast, any component inside a route can be thought of as a specific page.
- Anything that is outside of the BrowserRouter is not declared as an individual route within the application.

***3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested?***

- Those components become unmounted.
  - Each router creates a *history* object that it uses to keep track of the current location and re-renders the application whenever this location changes.
  - The `<Route/>` renders the appropriate user interface when the current location matches the routeâ€™s path.

***4. What does props.children contain?***

- `props.children` is a special prop, automatically passed to every component, that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
  - These kinds of components are identified as "boxes".
  - Allows us to compose components, and therefore our front-end interface.

***5. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?***

- `useState()` is a React hook which does not require creating a class.
  - It can be used with functional components, which simplifies the creation of a state component and the function that updates it.
- `this.setState()` is used to handle or change state within a React class component.

***6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **State Hook** - lets you add React state to function components, instead of having to convert them to a class.
- **Mounting and Un-Mounting** - DOM creation / "setup" and deletion / "cleanup" in a React component's lifecycle.
