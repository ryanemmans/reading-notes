# CLASS 26 NOTES - Component Based UI

***1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)***

- Vue, Angular, Svelte, Ember, Alpine

***2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?***

- When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.

***3. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:***

- **Rendering** - In React, the render() method is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be displayed to the browser window.
- **Templates** - refers to the client side data binding method implemented with JavaScript. A frequent practice is to use double curly brackets ( i.e. {{key}} ) to call values of the given key from data files, often JSON objects.
- **State** - a JavaScript object that stores a component’s dynamic data and enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.
