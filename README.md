>Prior to Code Fellows I bartended at some fancy cocktail bars out in Chicago for nearly a decade, but I've recently moved to Seattle to pursue a career change into tech. My education background is in furniture making, and I am passionate about all things design related. I love to ride bikes and go hiking in my free time, and am constantly trying to learn new things on just about any random subject. Iâ€™m very excited to be going through Code Fellows to build my skillset as an aspiring software developer, and am looking forward to all the challenges ahead!
