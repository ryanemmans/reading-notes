- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

#### ***2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?***

- It is an open-source high performance engine that uses ECMAScript and WebAssembly to compile and run JavaScript source code.
- It is used in Chrome, Node.js and others, and can run standalone or be embedded into any C++ application.

#### ***3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?***

- This is because Node.js is a program that can be used to execute JavaScript on a computer as opposed to the browswer.

- It can be used to download software packages.

- In terminal, you would type `npm install -g jshint`

#### ***8. What is node used for?***

- Node is used to run JavaScript on the server.
- Modern JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
- It is single threaded and event-driven, meaning everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
- It is especially good for apps that require real-time interaction and collaboration.
- Node enables the developer to create everything using the same language.
- Another plus is that it speaks JSON, which is a data exhange format.

#### ***1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?***

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

#### ***2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?***

- I personally have found engaged collaboration to be helpful as well as learning from other students.
- When collaborating, it's always interesting to see the various angles from which your colleagues may approach a problem.
- This brings new ideas to the table that you may not have thought of on your own.
- It is also a great space for both parties to learn a lot from each other with their distinct knowledge bases.

#### ***3. How does pair programming work?***

- It typical will involve the role of the Driver and the role of the Navigator.
- The Driver is the only one who is typing as well as handling the mechanics
- The Navigator does not write any code but uses their words to guide the driver
- The Navigator thinks about the big picture, and a second screen may be used to look up solutions and documentation.
