#### **1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

- Personal computers were starting to show up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

#### **2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

- It changed the narrative and became the story about who computers were typically being used by.
- This was the beginning of how "techie" culture was created.
- This narrative was evident even in popular '80s films.
- Because computers became marketed toward males, it meant women who wanted to pursue computer science may not have been as well prepared.

#### **1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

- We need a much stronger presence of underrepresented communities in tech, especially women and people of color.
- Even in tech, we (unfortunately) live in a white male dominated world. Given that tech plays an increasingly heavy role in all of our futures, it is imperative that companies become more balanced and that all communities and company products become better represented.
- From 2014 to 2017, some of these numbers are noticeably shifting in the favor of women and Asian communities as well as Black and Latino communities, which seems hopeful for the future of diversity in tech.

#### **1. When are diversity efforts most successful?**

- They are most successful when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders.
- Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

#### **2. Why do diverse companies perform better?**

- There are significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.
- Diverse groups bring more and different ways of seeing a problem, therefore faster and better ways to solve it.

#### **3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

- Specific user groups will be better represented, and companies will build more effectively for those groups.
- In the case of Pinterest, Tracy Chou explains - "We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."
