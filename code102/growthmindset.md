# Growth Mindset #
- A growth mindset could be described as the ability to grow through dedication and persistence. Through embracing obstacles head on, one can achieve more ambitious goals and acquire even more knowledge than they may have thought possible.

- In contrast, a fixed mindset could limit one by their current abilities or talents, and in turn one could fail to reach their full potential. Fear and doubt can lead to avoiding challenges, and growth could remain stagnant.

- Learning should be a life-long journey! Through a growth mindset, one can achieve success through their failures, criticisms, and maximum efforts as opposed to feeling held back by fear and hesitation.

### **How to Stay on Track?** ###
I remind myself to:
1. *Reframe negative thinking when confronted with an issue.*
2. *Stay focused and manage my time.*
3. *Find my flow.*
4. *Maintain a positive mental attitude.*
5. *Take breaks to avoid burnout.*
