# Programming with JavaScript:

Control flow - the order in which the computer executes statements in the script.

- First line to last line
- Conditionals and loops change the control flow
- Conditional is `if…else` structure
- Conditionals, loops ,and functions are all control structures,  making flows complex

## **Functions - blocks of code designed to perform a particular task**

- Executed when something invokes (or calls) it
- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)

```
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Arguments are values received by function when it is invoked

- These are parameters that behave as local variables

Invoking a function

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

Function Return

- `return` statement - function will stop executing
- Functions compute return values - back to “caller”

Code can be defined once and used many times, with different arguments for different results

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
Functions can be used the same way as variables, directly as variable value

- Variables become *local* to a function when declared within
  - they are only recognized inside their functions, are deleted when function is completed
  - same variable name as local can be used in different functions

Dry concept: DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF

What happens in the functions STAYS in the function

You can call a function multiple times in HTML

Refactoring makes code more efficient, but does not change outcome

Operator - capable of manipulating certain value or operand.

- Used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operand
- Operator operates the operands

Assignment Operators - assign value to variables

- =
- +=
- -=
- *=
- /=
- %=
- **=

Adding two numbers will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string
