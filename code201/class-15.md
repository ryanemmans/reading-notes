Google has spent millions of dollars measuring all aspects of their employees' lives to improve productivity, profitability, and success.

2012 - Project Aristotle

- Initiative to study hundreds of Google's teams to figure out why some struggled, and others did so well
- Rozovsky was hired as a researcher

Despite endless of arrangement of data, it was almost impossible to find patterns to prove that team composition made any difference.

## **Group Norms**

"Traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather."

- Typically override individual tendencies
- Researchers concluded this became key to improving Google's teams

### Which norms mattered most?

### Team A: disciplined, highly efficient and intelligent Vs. Team B: more laid back, friendly, average individuals

Collective I.Q. - team challenge studies yielded consistent results, success vs. failures

- A "good" vs dysfunctional team depended on how teammates *treated one another*.
- Despite *individual* intelligence, a group's *collective* intelligence could be raised by the *right* norms

Groups with average members took advantage of everyone's relative strengths.

Two behaviors shared by the successful teams

1. Members spoke roughly in same proportion

    - "Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."

2. High "average social sensitivity"

    - intuitive to how others felt based on tone of voice, expressions, and non-verbal cues
    - Reading the Mind in the Eyes test

### Opt for Team B

- ***The sum will be greater than its parts***

"We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."

### Psychological Safety

- "Shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."
- "A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up"
  - Interpersonal trust and mutual respect
